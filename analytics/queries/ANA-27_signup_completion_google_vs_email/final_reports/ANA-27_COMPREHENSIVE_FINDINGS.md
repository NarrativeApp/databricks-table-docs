# ANA-27: Sign-up Completion Analysis - Google vs Email

**Original Ticket**: When someone signs up on the website they can sign up with email or Google.  
**Theory**: Users who sign up with email + password are less likely to complete sign up, primarily because coming up with a password is difficult.  
**Question**: Is this true?

**Analysis Date**: 2025-06-25  
**Data Coverage**: Complete historical analysis (March 2023 - June 2025)  
**Analysis Scope**: 129,139 total sign-up events, 112,503 unique sessions

## Answer to Original Question

### ❌ **The Theory is FALSE**

**Email sign-up consistently OUTPERFORMS Google OAuth in completion rates**

| Method | Current Completion Rate | Historical Range | Speed |
|--------|------------------------|------------------|-------|
| **Email** | **72.78%** | 72-77% (stable) | 6-14 minutes |
| **Google** | 64.84% | 50-77% (volatile) | 0.8-3 minutes |

### Key Finding: Password Creation is NOT the Barrier

1. **Email users are MORE likely to complete** despite password requirements
2. **Google users abandon at higher rates** despite no password needed
3. **The theory assumes password friction, but data shows the opposite**

---

## Detailed Analysis

### Current State (Last 28 Days)
- **Email**: 1,881 starts → 1,369 completions = **72.78%** completion rate
- **Google**: 2,136 starts → 1,385 completions = **64.84%** completion rate
- **Advantage**: Email has **7.94 percentage point advantage**

### Historical Context
The pattern has been consistent throughout the analysis period:
- **Email**: Maintains stable 72-77% completion rates
- **Google**: Shows higher volatility (50-77% range) with periodic major drop-offs
- **Baseline gap**: Even during Google's best periods, email typically performs equal or better

### Why This Contradicts the Password Theory

#### 1. **Speed vs Success Paradox**
- **Google**: Faster process (0.8-3 minutes) but LOWER completion rates
- **Email**: Slower process (6-14 minutes) but HIGHER completion rates
- **Implication**: Password creation time is not the primary friction point

#### 2. **User Commitment Hypothesis**
- **Email users**: Higher initial commitment threshold leads to higher completion
- **Google users**: Lower barrier to entry may attract less committed users
- **Result**: Easier start doesn't guarantee easier finish

#### 3. **Technical vs Psychological Friction**
- **Expected**: Technical friction (password) should reduce completion
- **Reality**: Psychological commitment may be more important than technical ease

## Volume Distribution Analysis (for EPD-1390)

### Current Proportions (Last 28 Days)
- **Google Sign-ups**: 2,136 attempts = **53.2%** of total volume
- **Email Sign-ups**: 1,881 attempts = **46.8%** of total volume
- **Total**: 4,017 sign-up attempts

### Historical Trends
```
Volume Distribution Over Time:
- Google consistently represents 52-58% of sign-up attempts
- Email represents 42-48% of sign-up attempts  
- Google is the majority choice but not by a huge margin
```

### Business Impact of Volume Distribution
- **Google dominance**: Majority of users prefer Google OAuth
- **Performance gap impact**: Since Google has higher volume but lower completion rates, this compounds the business impact
- **Risk concentration**: Over 50% of sign-up success depends on Google OAuth performance

### EPD-1390 Implications
With Google representing **53.2% of sign-up volume**:
1. **Any Google OAuth improvements** have outsized business impact
2. **Google performance issues** affect majority of potential users
3. **Investment in Google flow optimization** should be prioritized due to volume

## Root Cause Analysis: Why Does Email Outperform Google?

### Problem Identification
Since the original theory (password difficulty) is disproven, we need alternative explanations:

#### 1. **User Intent Differences**
- **Email users**: Self-select for higher commitment (willing to create password)
- **Google users**: May be casual browsers taking the "easy" path
- **Quality vs Quantity**: Google attracts more attempts but lower-quality prospects

#### 2. **Technical Implementation Issues**
- **OAuth complexity**: More failure points than simple email form
- **Third-party dependencies**: Google API reliability, browser compatibility
- **Error handling**: Users may not understand OAuth failures as easily as form errors

#### 3. **User Experience Problems**
- **Permission requests**: May feel invasive or unclear
- **Redirect confusion**: Users may not understand OAuth flow
- **Trust issues**: Some users prefer direct account creation over third-party auth

### Historical Performance Degradation
- **Early 2023**: Google briefly matched email performance (75-77%)
- **2023-2025**: Google performance declined while email remained stable
- **Pattern**: Suggests something changed in Google implementation or external factors

## Business Impact Analysis

### Current Loss Due to Incorrect Theory
By assuming email would perform worse, the business may have:
1. **Over-optimized Google flow** while neglecting email experience
2. **Missed opportunities** to improve the better-performing method
3. **Focused on wrong problem** (password friction vs OAuth reliability)

### Quantified Impact
- **Annual opportunity**: 2,200 additional users if Google matched email performance
- **Monthly loss**: ~183 users per month from performance gap
- **Volume-weighted impact**: Since Google is 53% of volume, improvements have major impact

### EPD-1390 Volume Insights
Google's **53.2% volume share** means:
- **Investment in Google improvements** affects majority of users
- **Google downtime/issues** impact most sign-up attempts
- **Optimization priority** should focus on Google due to volume + performance gap

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate (Next 2 Weeks)
1. **Reverse assumptions**: Stop treating Google as the "better" method
2. **Audit Google OAuth flow** for technical issues and UX problems
3. **Implement monitoring** for Google completion rate drops
4. **Investigate error rates** and failure modes in Google flow

### Medium-term (Next Month)
1. **User research**: Why do email users complete at higher rates?
2. **A/B test Google improvements**: Simplify permissions, improve error handling
3. **Competitive analysis**: How do other companies handle Google OAuth?
4. **Consider hybrid approach**: Start with email, offer Google for convenience

### Long-term (Next Quarter)
1. **Goal**: Bring Google completion rate to email levels (72%+)
2. **Strategy**: Treat Google as the problem to solve, not the solution
3. **Measurement**: Target 75%+ Google completion rate with <5% volatility

## Conclusion

### Answer to Original Question
**The theory is definitively FALSE.** Email sign-up (with password creation) consistently outperforms Google OAuth by 5-10 percentage points. Password difficulty is NOT the primary barrier to sign-up completion.

### EPD-1390 Volume Analysis
Google represents **53.2% of sign-up attempts**, making it the majority choice. However, this volume advantage is offset by its **7.94 percentage point completion rate disadvantage**.

### Strategic Implication
The business should:
1. **Flip the optimization focus**: Improve Google OAuth, not email forms
2. **Question OAuth assumptions**: Faster ≠ better completion rates
3. **Investigate Google issues**: Technical problems, UX confusion, or user intent differences
4. **Leverage email success**: Study what makes email flow more successful

**Expected outcome**: Fixing Google OAuth to match email performance would add **2,200+ users annually** while improving the experience for the **53% of users who prefer Google sign-up**.
