# ANA-27: Sign-up Completion Analysis - Google vs Email

Analysis investigating the theory: "Users who sign up with email + password are less likely to complete sign up, primarily because coming up with a password is difficult."

## 🎯 Key Finding: **Theory is FALSE**

**Email actually outperforms Google OAuth** across all platforms and contexts.

## 📊 Main Results

### Overall Performance (All-time)
- **Email sign-ups**: 72.78% completion rate
- **Google OAuth**: 64.84% completion rate
- **Gap**: Email +7.94 percentage points better

### Platform-Specific Results
- **Desktop**: Google works well (73-77% completion)
- **Mobile**: Google has major issues (56-61% completion)
- **Email**: Consistent 70-78% across all platforms

## 🚨 Critical Issues Discovered

1. **Mobile Google OAuth is broken**: 56-61% completion vs 70-78% email
2. **In-app browsers are OAuth death traps**: 13-24% completion rates
3. **Platform-specific patterns**: iOS Safari and Android Chrome have specific failures

## 📋 Recommendations

### Immediate (0-30 days)
1. **Fix mobile Google OAuth** - Focus on iOS Safari and Android Chrome
2. **Implement in-app browser detection** - Route to email signup
3. **A/B test mobile OAuth improvements**

### Medium-term (30-90 days)
1. **Platform-specific OAuth flows**
2. **Progressive enhancement** - Start with email, enhance with OAuth
3. **Monitoring dashboards** for real-time completion rate tracking

### Strategic Impact
- **Potential gain**: +300-400 annual users from mobile OAuth fixes
- **Risk mitigation**: Protect against growing mobile/social traffic

## 🏁 Conclusion

The original theory that email signup is harder than Google OAuth is **definitively false**. The real issue is that **Google OAuth is broken on mobile platforms**, while email works consistently across all contexts. Priority should be fixing mobile OAuth, not promoting it over email.
